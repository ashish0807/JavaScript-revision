## Here we will learn about JavaScript
### JavaScript : It is a lightweight interpreted programming language with first class functions. It is a prototype based, single-threaded, dynamic language.

```javascript

console.log("Ashish");

console.info();

console.warn();

console.error();

console.debug();

console.table(["Ashish","Homelander","butcher"]); //this will print multiple variables at once on the form of key and values;

console.dir(); //this will show the directory.

```

### "use strict" : Strict mode is then a sneaky way to get some breaking changes in without breaking anything. Browser look for the “use strict” string at the top of a scope, and will handle various existing syntax in different ways. This will not break any existing web pages because they won’t use the string. The new(ish) EcmaScript modules are also automatically in strict mode without needing the string.

### "use client" : The “use client” string or any other string like this is custom behavior defined by a particular library. They would have to implement it by doing custom transformations to the JavaScript code based on a compiler finding the string. You probably could define your own too, but it would mean writing your own customer transformer to plug into a build system like webpack.
